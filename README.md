Forestica
=========

**[Forestica]** is a Tilt Brush scene drawn by [George Peaslee]. This
repository contains a setup for rendering it with [Unity].

How to Set Up
-------------

This repository doesn't contain the original scene files. They have to be
downloaded separately. Then copy them in the following steps.

- Copy the fbx file into `Assets/Forestica/source`.
- Copy the png files into `Assets/Forestica/textures`.

It's recommended to copy these files before opening the project for the first
time because Unity will remove .meta files if the asset files don't exist.
